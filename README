# I initially missed the reference code provided, so I approached the assessment from my prespective. 
# I built a version that supports concurrent checks using threading, includes timeout handling, and tracks availability with both response codes and latency. 
# Looking back, I see how the reference was intended as a simpler baseline, 
# but I tried to make my solution,
# production-oriented,
# more detailed logging,
# performance considerations.


SRE Availability Checker

This script monitors the availability of HTTP endpoints defined in a YAML configuration file. It periodically checks each endpoint and reports availability.

Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) 

Setup Instructions (using pipx)

1. Ensure `pipx` is installed

If you havenâ€™t already:

```bash
sudo apt install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

2. Install dependencies using "pipx run"

```bash
pipx run pip install requests pyyaml
```

Usage

Make sure both the Python script and the YAML config file are in your working directory.

Run the script:

```bash
python main.py config.yaml
```

This will:
- Parse endpoints from the YAML config
- Send HTTP requests every 15 seconds
- Evaluate availability (2xx response within 500ms)
- Print availability reports per domain


CHABGES AND ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND ALSO PROVIDED A REASON FOR THE CHANGE.

1 . ENTIRE FILE STRUCTURE WAS CHANGED 

    - The originally given YAML file didn't have a list indicaters at the start of each endpoint definition , which makes it an invalid YAML file. without these a parsar ( like we using pyyaml) would fail with a syntax error like a scannererro.

2 . REORDERED FIELDS FOR CONSISTENCY.

   - The original YAML file don't follow the order of name, url, method, headers, body in every endpoint.

3 . FIXED URL LINE BREAKS

   - Theer was URL splits across the lines in the original yaml file and merged split url's to avoid the invalid url error.
